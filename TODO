- If a label (jumpdst) has nothing jumping to it, delete it.

- If a jump has no matching label (jumpdst), show the label's name.

- Hovering over a jumpdst should show the label's name.

- Hovering over a jump should cause the argument with the label to show.

- Hovering over a jump, jumpdst, or the jump line should highlight all three.

- Set alt text for memory labels so a copy/paste is reasonableish

- Arc algorithm, gives pretty square corners for very short jumps and very flat ones for long jumps. How I calculate the control points should change.  Perhaps I do want quadratic curves instead of cubic?

- Cleanup hrm.js.

- The load of the program causes a "syntax error" in the console log. I think it's because Firefox (possibly via jQuery) tried to parse it as JSON or XML. May just be jQuery trying to autodetect and nothing we can do about it.

- Give the label SVG's lines a class to set the color.

- For my pages, tell mobile browsers I'm mobile aware.

- Better errors if can't load file.
