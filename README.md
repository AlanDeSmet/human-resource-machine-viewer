This is a Javascript program that takes a program copied out of [Human Resource Machine](http://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine) and renders it similarly to the original game.

While the code is functional, it's not quite ready for public use.  More documentation (and a suitable license for re-use) soon!
